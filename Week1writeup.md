# Week 1 Write-Up

Hey, I'm **Adriano**, and I'm a member of the 2017 **Harvard iGEM** team. In November, we'll be presenting a synthetic biology project that we just started to work on. Our project's about hijacking biopolymers - protein and sugar fibers extruded by bacteria - to make functional biomaterials. That is, getting those protein and sugar fibers to do stuff. Kill bacteria, shine red, stick to ship hulls, you name it.

Our first work week of the summer is already done and dusted. Because we didn't have our lab benches finalized and our DNA constructs haven't come in yet, we weren't able to get in the lab this week except to get a brief tour and stock our benches. So, we read a lot, we discussed a lot, and we tried to plan our summer in the lab from some tables in the common area. It's much easier said than done.

I don't have a background working in long-term research projects like this nor am I familiar with most of the protocols we'll be doing over the summer, so it was tough to create a rough outline of our experiments over the summer. What does creating and screening a library look like? How long does 'x' experiment take? What collection of day-by-day protocols will match our overarching project objectives? Right after the semester ended, I couldn't begin to grapple with these simple questions. So, I spent quite a bit of time between the end of school and the start of our time in Boston spinning my wheels.

After a week, though, I have a better grasp of the project's goals and the steps we have to take, experimentally, to reach them. This is meant to be a discussion of what helped me orient myself to a new, unfamiliar project. The level of specificity is not such that it can act as a roadmap, but it may be helpful for budding undergraduate researchers to get started.

The first thing that helped was **talking** to the rest of the team and Francis, our project mentor. The amount of literature relating to synthetic biology is overwhelming; it's a time-intensive task to sift through everything relevant to a project, and my familiarity with the topic is not such that I could afford to skim these materials. I found the process of learning and gaining a base of familiarity was much quicker when I was talking, not reading. An engaged person in conversation is much more attune to your needs as a learner than the results of a search engine or the words in an academic paper. So, when tackling a new project, a good course of action is to talk to people who know what they're talking about. For me, that meant the project mentor or other team members who had more expertise (or had done more research already) in a certain area. If nothing else, conversation also helps to wrap a mind around a difficult concept. It seems intuitive looking back, but gaining knowledge through talking is imperative when doing something new.

The second thing that helped me was **modularizing**, that is breaking up larger tasks into smaller and smaller tasks. Long-term projects - even a 10-week project - can seem daunting if you're at the beginning and thinking about the final product in its entirety. At the outset, project goals are often more amorphous and indeterminate than we would care to admit. But, subdividing that large project into smaller parts is essential to getting started. It allowed me to wrap my head around what needed to be done and what could get done immediately. It gave me direction. First, our project was divided into five main categories, each headed by a member of the team: experimental design data and analysis (that's mine!), hardware, software and web design, modelling, and narrative/human relations. With the direction of my mentor, I then subdivided the experimental component into five main experiments; then, I broke that down into a list of protocols that go into each experiment. Now, it's just a matter of gathering those protocols and implementing them in the lab. Of course, things will change over the summer, but I left this week with a framework for the experimental design and data analysis component of the project. I know all the small tasks that comprise the greater one. It takes a while to get to that point sometimes, but it's no doubt important.

Put simply, talking with other people gets your base of knowledge to where it needs to be the fastest. Meanwhile, modularizing the project breaks it into smaller parts that the human mind can better understand. If I had to do it over again, I would begin both processes much earlier than I did.
